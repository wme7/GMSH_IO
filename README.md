# GMSHparser
This repo contains Matlab and C++17 (prototypes) parsers that are designed to read Gmsh's *.msh-files written format v2.2 and v4.1, according to the [Gmsh 4.9.4](https://gmsh.info/doc/texinfo/gmsh.html) reference guide.

While the Matlab prototypes are self-explanatory, the C++17 equivalents are a pure header implementations. Moreover, these implementations are highly minimalistic and are aimed to be easy to read and maintain.

This is done deliberately, so that they can be adapted and modified to any target application/code by any C++ beginner.
